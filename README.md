📊 Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2026

This repository documents my journey through the Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2026, a free 9‑week course on data engineering fundamentals. It includes notes, homework, and projects covering:

- Containerization & Infrastructure as Code (Docker, Terraform, GCP)
- Workflow Orchestration (Kestra, Airflow/Prefect concepts)
- Data Ingestion & Normalization
- Data Warehousing (BigQuery, partitioning, clustering, ML)
- Analytics Engineering (dbt, DuckDB, modeling, testing)
- Batch Processing (Apache Spark)
- Streaming (Kafka, Avro, KSQL)
- Final Project: End‑to‑end data pipeline

The repo serves as a learning log and resource for anyone following the Zoomcamp.
